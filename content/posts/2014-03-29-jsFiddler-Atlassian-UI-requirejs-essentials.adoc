I need to prototype a Backbone view using Atlassian UI, so I've created a jsFiddler to help me. Just sharing...

Fork it. If you have any problems or suggestions, do let me know.

And http://jsfiddle.net/faizhasim/9uKvw/1/[this] is my currently work on trying to turn AUI Dialog2 as a BackboneView. I wrote in CoffeeScript, so I just quickly copy the compiled JS into jsFiddler and add some calls to test my prototype.
