So, I have a jar of tea leaves and garam masala. So, let's make some spiced chai, shall we?

Basically, I put the tea leaves and garam masala into the portafilter. Switch on the espresso machine and let it brew for a couple of minutes. Put 2 teaspoon of sugar into the cup. Pour in milk. And done, my easy peasy spiced chai.

    ps: Atm, I'm still thinking on the API design for this multi query search system. How to achieve good performance of tree data structure searching against typical relational database without introducing too much complexities? I've created custom index last time, not quite sure whether I want to do it again. Should I?
