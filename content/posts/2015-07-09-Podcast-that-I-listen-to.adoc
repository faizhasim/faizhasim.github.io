## Technology-Related Podcasts

### The Agile Coffee Podcast

- A bunch of agilist discussing software development practices and process in a lean coffee format.

- Video podcast about AngularJS (although I only listen).
- I rarely listen to this, but it really focused on anything related to AngularJS.

- Podcast that discussed various aspects of AWS offerings.
- I don't particularly enjoy this podcast. It sounds like sales talk to me, not so much technical depth.

### AWS re:Invent 2014

- Over 200 collections of technical sessions, covering architecture, operations, security etc.
- Highly recommended podcast if you are interested in architecture with AWS or containerization.

- Weekly podcast on open source projects.
- I would recommend this to know what's happening in the open source community.
- You might even use some of the promoted open source projects.

### Cloudy Chat

- Highly recommended podcast if you want to know more about cloud computing.
- I particularly like the talks on containerizations, Redhat project on project atomic etc.

### Ember Land

- Podcast on EmberJS, which, honestly, I don't listen much.

### Frontside the Podcast

- Podcast focussing on EmberJS (but sometimes general software engineering).
- It's on okay podcast.

### The Java Posse

- Podcast for Java community since 2005.
- They no longer producing new episodes, but some of the episodes are still very interesting to listen.

### JavaScript Jabber

- I absolutely love this JSJ podcast by Charles Max Wood.
- They talk pretty much anything about Javascript.

- It's one of the podcast that I usually listens to.

- I would definitely recommend this podcast.
- It has a good balance of contents, including architecture, technology explorations and software development practices.

- Discussion-oriented podcast relating to the Scala programming language and its community.

### Muslim Central - Mufti Ismail ibn Musa Menk

- Mufti Ismail Musa Menk was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, and is perhaps best known for his engagements as a guest speaker in South Africa each Ramadan.
- In this podcast, he talks about Islamic theologies, practices, sirah and Quran tafseer (exegesis / deep translation of the verses).

### Muslim Central - Nourman Ali Khan

- Nourman Ali Khan is the founder and CEO of Bayyinah.
- I haven't started listening to this podcast as I'm currently listening to Yasir Qadhi's. But I am really looking forward to this!
