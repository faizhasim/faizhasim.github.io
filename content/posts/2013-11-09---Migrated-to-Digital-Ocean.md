I am quite excited to today to announce that my blog has been migrated from [faizhasim.bitnamiapp.com](http://faizhasim.bitnamiapp.com) to [www.faizhasim.com](http://www.faizhasim.com). I actually bought a `.com` domain for RM6.00/year with promotion code from GoDaddy.

[faizhasim.bitnamiapp.com](http://faizhasim.bitnamiapp.com) was hosted on Amazon Elastic Cloud architecture (or Amazon Web Services as a whole). AWS could be a little bit on the expensive side when it comes to normal blog/publication hosting, but I got 1 year free hosting, so I might as well use it. The old blog run on plain ol' Wordpress.

Now, I migrated from Wordpress to [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org), a blogging platform written ground-up on top of NodeJS stack. I like their mission statement:

> Just a blogging platform

## Why I like Ghost?

#### __(Let say instead of Wordpress)__

* Backed by dedicated designer who aim to make UI/UX simple, clean and "mobile-first".
* Ghost is designed for the best blogging experience, which translates to:
	* Easy system for me to maintain.
    * No convoluted PHP code mess like Wordpress.
    * Written in NodeJS with Handlebar templating, which means easier for me to override the themes.
* Community driven. It's actually crowd-funded project.

## Migrated from AWS to Digital Ocean

AWS is expensive for blogging. I do not need elasticity, although server elasticity is a very nice addition to any application including blogging platform.

I have reviewed some cloud-based hosting and VPS. I have considered Linode, they are basically using VPS pricing model, but elastic enough to behave like a cloud-based service. As a matter of fact, Linode **is** running on cloud infrastructure. They have very good reviews on customer relation and supports. I did consider that, till I found Digital Ocean. The pricing model is very simple. For USD 5/month you can get 20 GB of SSD storage and 512 MB of RAM. Perfect to start up a blog. Furthermore, I manage to grab a promotion code which give me USD 10 credit.

## Going back to why do this ...

My last post was in June 2013 and I am thinking of writing again. Similarly, my goal is to express my opinion mostly, but not limited to software development. Additionally, this time, I might chuck in some tutorials on programming if I have some time. I think I have learn a lot from all those free tutorials from the Internet. It is the right time to contribute back to the community. 

> If you need me to write or explain anything (especially software development related (Java/JS/Objective C etc), let me know.
