I've been following the CoreData tutorial and I receive following errors during linking:

    Undefined symbols for architecture i386:
      "_NSSQLiteStoreType", referenced from:
          -[AppDelegate persistentStoreCoordinator] in AppDelegate.o

Turns out, `CoreData.framework` wasn't in my project. Adding that to the build phase solve the problem. As simple as that.
