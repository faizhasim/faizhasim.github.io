I've been using https://doo.net[Doo] for couple of weeks to re-evaluate the product. I must say, it looks good especially for personal document management system. Here's what I feel about this product:

- Included `Rules` feature so I can automate certain trivial, but repeatative task, for example tagging my Mobile bill statement. It's like mini-version of http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php[Hazel]. 
  * Works really well for my usage.
  * I wish they add more conditions, like reading certain  extended attributes of file (like source url). But, I understand that it will be harder to support that for a multiplatform product.
- Multiple `Storage Location`, but not working seamlessly as I expected
 * For some reason, I can't link my evernote account.
 * Some documents scanned into my Mac cannot be successfully sync via Doo Cloud. I can't see some of the documents from the iPhone app.
 * I synced Doo from Evernote, but it didn't work on Mac app. However, it work fine on iPhone app.
- Intelligent automated tagging
 * Able to populate related companies based on the document content.
 * Able to extract related contacts based on document content and populate it in the People field. Imo, really good feature for correspondence email system.
- No revision control
 * Which is really a shame.
