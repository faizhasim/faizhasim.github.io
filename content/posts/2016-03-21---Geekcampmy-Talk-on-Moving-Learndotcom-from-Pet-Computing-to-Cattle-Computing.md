I had a change to share some works that we recently did for 
[Learndot.com](https://www.learndot.com) platform during the [Geekcamp.my](http://www.geekcamp.my/) event.
It's about moving the Learndot platform from `Pet computing` to `Cattle computing`, by leveraging AWS cloud.

You can take a look at the slides using the link below.

<blockquote>
    <div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
        NOTE: I created the slides for my talk for offline presentation and I didn't really compress the assets.
        So, it might take some time to load all the 50MB worth of  uncompressed images, animated GIFs and all.
        So, you really might want to grab some coffee
