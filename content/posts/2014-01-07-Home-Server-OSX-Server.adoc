We are expecting to receive a new machine soon, I think I need to start acting more seriously on managing our machines, backups of photos, videos etc and managing our home infra mainly for entertainment purposes.

I don't think that I can complete everything in one go. So, I will do it slowly but progresively. Now, my objective is to automate OS X updates using OSX Server app. 

The OSX Server will be installed on our iMac, acting as our home server. Hopefully, we can save some broadband bandwidth and time for upgrades. So far, I don't think I will use other services offered by OSX Server.
