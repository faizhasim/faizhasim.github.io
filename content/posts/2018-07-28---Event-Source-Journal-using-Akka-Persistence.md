I had the opportunity to spike a demo in our office and share my understanding on `EventSourcing` implementation using Akka Persistence.
The slides are compiled into the following link:

[lightning-eventsourcing-akka.pdf](https://github.com/faizhasim/faizhasim.github.io/files/2237851/lightning-eventsourcing-akka.pdf)


The code itself can be found on Github [faizhasim/lightning-talk-akka-persistence](https://github.com/faizhasim/lightning-talk-akka-persistence).

And here is a random video that I made last year.
