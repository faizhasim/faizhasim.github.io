You simply\njust can’t use it.</p>\n<p>I am quite certain ChromeOS on actual Chromebook won’t be an issue. Still, I was trying out my luck with Chromium OS\nto log in via a child account. Nope, it does not work. Period. However, you are still able to log in as a guess user\nand manually log in via Google services on the Chromium browser. I just feel thto at the experience is too cumbersome,\nespecially if I want to help my son focus on the actual work, rather than wasting time to login to multiple services\nevery single time.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"i-end-up-using-chromium-os\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-end-up-using-chromium-os\" aria-label=\"i end up using chromium os permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I end up using Chromium OS</h2>\n<p>The experience in using Chromium OS, especially as a introductory OS to kids, is very welcoming. I am keeping the\nRaspberry PI as a “dumb terminal” and ensure the actual work are saved to the cloud. Thus, I will just leave it here for\nnow.</p>\n<p>Just letting you know that as of today, the latest Chromium OS running on r77, which is quite dated.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"so-far\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-far\" aria-label=\"so far permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So far…</h2>\n<p>Well, so far it works. My son was playing and learning block coding on <a href=\"https://code.org/minecraft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://code.org/minecraft</a>.\nThe early part are just revision for him.</p>\n<p>My other son, a 5 year old, use this briefly to complete a couple of questions from his Google Classroom assignments\nfrom school. It was a counting exercise and he looks annoyed with different interactivity experience compared to iPad.\nI think, he would prefer iPad at his age - simpler to interact, simpler to count and still better experience in general. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/raspberry-pi-a-pc-for-my-son-part-2","tagSlugs":["/tag/raspberry-pi/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-04T11:43:52","description":"Helping my son to setup Raspberry PI - solving problem in previous part on family link.","tags":["raspberry pi"],"title":"Raspberry PI: A PC for My Son - Part 2","socialImage":"/media/minecraft-hour-of-code-on-pi.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/raspberry-pi-a-pc-for-my-son-part-2"}}}
