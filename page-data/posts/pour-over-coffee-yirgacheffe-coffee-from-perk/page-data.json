I subscribed for freshly roasted coffee\nservice from <a href=\"https://perkcoffee.co/my/?promo=mohdfaiz5701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Perk</a>. </p>\n<p>If your are interested, get their bean from my link to get RM25.00 off your first order below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://perkcoffee.co/my/?promo=mohdfaiz5701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://perkcoffee.co/my/?promo=mohdfaiz5701</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I started to drink espresso with milk then, I started to skip sugar and milk. At one point of time, I stop brewing on\nthe espresso machine and use Aeropress almost exclusively. While I still very rarely use the Aeropress, my current\nbrewing technique is not predominantly pour over using V60. </p>\n<p>I am not saying that I am a true coffee aficionado, but the taste that I’m looking for is bright and clean taste\nwith a bit of mellow and sweetness. At the same time, I want to be pragmatic in terms of the approach, the money/cost\nfactor, the time and effort and more importantly the joy of a cup of good coffee.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fo8tEu5uIo4\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe></div> </div></p>\n<p>With Perks coffee, I have tried other blends or origins, but I end up getting this bean for pour over coffee. There are\nother reputable brewers in the region.

Ultimately, taste and overall experience depends on your tastebuds.</p>\n<p>I always brew for 300ml end result because that is the maximum volume of my cup. I use about 18g of coffee bean.\nMedium grind (took couple of tries with my grinder to get the right taste). Water is about 90-ish to 95 degree Celsius.</p>\n<p>I am not qualified enough to give you recipe but I can share some of my personal hacks/tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the coffee is bitter, chances that your grind is too fine.\nLikewise, if it’s under-extracted, they are probably too coarse.</li>\n<li>If you hate to wait for boiled water to cool down (morning rush to work), put couple of ice cubes while brewing.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://perkcoffee.co/my/product/ethiopia-yirgacheffe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ethiopia Yirgacheffe coffee beans</a> taste wonderful with\ncold brew too. My hack for cold brew is to put about 30g of grinded coffee in the V60 paper filter and immerse it with\ncold water in a mug. Wait till the next morning, and you got a nice cold brewed coffee.\nI did this quite regularly when fasting during Ramadan.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/pour-over-coffee-yirgacheffe-coffee-from-perk","tagSlugs":["/tag/coffee/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-25T10:58:01","description":"to write","tags":["coffee"],"title":"Pour Over Coffee - Yirgacheffe Coffee from Perk","socialImage":"/media/v60-coffee.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/pour-over-coffee-yirgacheffe-coffee-from-perk"}}}
