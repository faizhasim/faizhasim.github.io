Originally it was username: <code class=\"language-text\">tmadmin</code> and password: <code class=\"language-text\">tmadmin</code>. This is the unrestricted account.</p>\n<p>And now, I want to reboot the modem and I forgot that password! I’ve tried to login using tmuser but there’s no option to reboot the modem.</p>\n<p>Cut to the chase, with just some HTML debugging using Chrome debugger, I found out that this modem wasn’t designed to be secured at all. The password is in plain text and the validation was done purely on the UI level.</p>\n<p>Just go to <a href=\"http://192.168.1.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://192.168.1.1</a>, and log in using as any user (<code class=\"language-text\">tmadmin</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">tmuser</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">support</code>). Then go to <a href=\"http://192.168.1.1/password.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://192.168.1.1/password.html</a>. View the source and you’ll see something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;\n&lt;!-- hide\npwdAdmin = &#39;12345678&#39;;\npwdSupport = &#39;support&#39;;\npwdUser = &#39;tmuser&#39;;</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, for this case, now I know that “tmadmin” password is 12345678.</p>\n<p>So, moral of story is: Even though you have changed password for the <code class=\"language-text\">tmadmin</code> user, it’s not enough. You will need to change the password for non-admin users such as <code class=\"language-text\">tmuser</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">support</code>, because this modem security is absolute joke.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-recover-admin-password-for-streamyx-modem-dsl-2640b","tagSlugs":["/tag/modem/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-11-30T17:28:42","description":"Last month, I've changed the admin password for this modem.
