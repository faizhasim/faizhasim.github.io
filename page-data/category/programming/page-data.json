People that come from Node, might feel easier to get started without investing too much learning curve. JVM people might benefits Golang for faster startup time.\nIn the past, I made a careful decision to implement HTTP serverless using Node, due to the cold start concerns with JVM.

If I’m were to break down a large Node serverless function, I wouldn’t mind using Golang.","category":"Programming","title":"Golang: A Journey So Far"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/programming/","slug":"/posts/functional-programming-concept-and-example"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-27T17:28:42","description":"Sharing my slide during my introductory sharing session in the office on the concepts and examples for practical functional programming.","category":"Programming","title":"Functional Programming: Concept & Example"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/programming/","slug":"/posts/eventSource-journal-using-akka-persistence"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-07-28T17:28:42","description":"I had the opportunity to spike a demo in our office and share my understanding on `EventSourcing` implementation using Akka Persistence.","category":"Programming","title":"EventSource Journal using Akka Persistence"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/programming/","slug":"/posts/seekcamp-my-talk-on-moving-learndot-from-pet-computing-to-cattle-computing"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-03-21T17:28:42","description":"I had a change to share some works that we recently did for Learndot.com platform during the Geekcamp.my event.
